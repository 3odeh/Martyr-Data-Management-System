# Martyr Data Management System

## Description
The Martyr Program is a project that implements a data structure using sorted doubly and single linked lists. It is designed to hold information about martyrs, including their name, age, date of death, and gender. The program allows users to load a martyrs csv file, interact with the data through a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX, and perform various functions such as inserting new location records, updating or deleting existing records, searching for records, and generating summary reports.



## Features

- Load martyrs csv file
- Create a sorted single linked list to hold martyr object information
- Create a sorted doubly linked list that contains the location and a single list of martyr objects
- Insert new location records
- Update or delete location records
- Search for location records and load associated martyr records
- Update or delete martyr records
- Search for martyr records by name
- Generate summary reports for selected locations, including the number of martyrs by age and gender, average age of martyrs, and date with the maximum number of martyrs
- Navigate through locations using next and previous buttons
- Save updated linked lists back to a file in the same format as the input file
